# Studystash
A student's perfect assistant.

This is the open-source code for our new project: Studystash
Studystash is a simple bookmark homepage tool designed for school as a template which IT Departments can then adapt and apply to their own "Student Portals". It uses TailwindCSS to create an approachble, simple GUI with easy to understand code for departments to edit. It is designed for school devices which alter the "New Tab" feature to redirect to a student-designed portal. However, these can be bland, boring and outdated. With Studystash's databases and dynamic content generation, students can personalise their hub's to their heart's content. It's the perfect solution for students and teachers. 

Staff + Enterprise version is still being worked out.
