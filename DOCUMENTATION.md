# Studystash
This is the open-source code for our new project: Studystash
Studystash is a simple bookmark homepage tool designed for school as a template which IT Departments can then adapt and apply to their own "Student Portals". It uses TailwindCSS to create an approachble, simple GUI with easy to understand code for departments to edit. It is designed for school devices which alter the "New Tab" feature to redirect to a student-designed portal. However, these can be bland, boring and outdated. With Studystash's databases and dynamic content generation, students can personalise their hub's to their heart's content. It's the perfect solution for students and teachers. 

Staff + Enterprise version is still being worked out.

## Deployment
You can completely fork this repository and customise it to however you wish, but adhere to the EULA. This project relies on dynamic content generation, which is something that GitHub pages CANNOT do. Ensure you deploy the project on a dynamic host. This project uses MySQL for the database. This project does withhold some content that is used on the official Studystash deployment. You can self-host the project, but certain features will not work uness you host on a server with the MySQL database. We encode the data with SHA-256 to ensure user privacy. 

## Features
We allow user customisability such as themes, styles and positioning for completely free. Using TailwindCSS, we can make customizable advanced UIs for each and every person. Also, with custom themes, users can upload their own CSS, using JavaScript, to completely personalise their own deployments. Also, with the account system, students and users have their settings saved locally and limited to just them to ensure everyone has their own experience.
